# Creativestack

**The AI skill suite for creative professionals.** 44 Claude Code skills built specifically for creative agencies, branding agencies, and creative freelancers.

Every skill supports the creative process — research, briefs, strategy, project management, business operations — without ever generating creative output. The creative leap stays human.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camawjones/creativestack ~/.claude/skills/creativestack
bash ~/.claude/skills/creativestack/bin/build-skills.sh
```

The build script generates all `SKILL.md` files from templates and creates the symlinks that Claude Code needs to discover each skill. Restart Claude Code after installing.

## Quick Start

1. Set up your agency context (optional but recommended):
   - Type `/setup-agency` in Claude Code
   - Answer questions about your agency, team, and tone of voice
   - This creates your Agency Context Vault at `~/.creativestack/`

2. Start using skills:
   - `/meeting-notes` — paste a transcript, get structured notes with actions
   - `/brief-sharpener` — sharpen a client brief with gap analysis
   - `/timeline-generator` — generate a project timeline (with optional Figma output)

## Agency Context Vault

Skills work without any setup, but they work dramatically better with context about your agency. Run `/setup-agency` to create your vault at `~/.creativestack/` with:

- **agency.md** — company name, size, location, specialisms
- **tone-of-voice.md** — how your agency sounds (do/don't, vocabulary, examples)
- **team.md** — who does what
- **clients.md** — active clients and key contacts
- **case-studies.md** — index of past work
- **methodology.md** — how you run your processes
- **tools.md** — your software stack
- **learnings.md** — accumulated project learnings

## Figma Integration

11 skills can optionally render their output as designed Figma artifacts via the Figma MCP. When available, skills will ask if you want visual output — the markdown version always works as a fallback.
