### User Type Adaptation

When a skill needs to reference the user's organisation, read the `type` field from
`profile.md` in the brain. Use the mapping below to adapt language:

| User type | Referred to as | "Clients" become | "Team" becomes | Has team file? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| `freelancer` | "your practice" | "your clients" | N/A | No |
| `studio` | "your studio" | "your clients" | "your team" | Yes (flat list) |
| `agency` | "your agency" | "your clients" | "your team" | Yes (departments) |
| `in-house` | "your team" | "your stakeholders" | "your team" | Yes (flat list) |
| `company` | "your company" | "your clients" | "your team" | Yes (departments optional) |
| `other` | {custom descriptor from profile.md} | "your clients" | "your team" | Yes (flat list) |

If no brain exists or no `type` field is set, default to neutral language: "your work",
"your clients", "your team". Do not assume agency.

**Skill chain filtering by type:**
- `freelancer`: de-prioritise resource-conflict, job-description
- `in-house`: de-prioritise proposal-generator, rfi-response, sow-generator
- All other types: suggest any relevant skill
